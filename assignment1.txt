## Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans. Python is called general purpose language because it's application is not specific to a single domain instead it can be used in multiple domain serving multiple purpose. Python is also a high level programming language because it is written in human understandable language. While executing it needed to be interpreted and compiled in a machine understandable language.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans. When we declare or initialise any variables in python we need not to determine it's type that means python will itself assign data types during runtime itself
that means it is a dynamically typed language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans.
The pros of Python
  Python is easy to learn and read
  Python enhances productivity
  Python has a vast collection of libraries
  Python is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community
  Python is a portable programming language
  Python is an interpreted language
  
The cons of python programming language
  Python has speed limitations
  Python is not so strong with mobile computing
  Python can have runtime errors
  Python consumes a lot of memory space
  Python is not easy to test

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans.
  Machine learning / Artificial intelligence
  Desktop GUI
  Data analytics and data visualization 
  Web development
  Game development
  Mobile app development
  Embedded systems
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans.Variables are just a name given to any specific memory location it hold some values.
    syntax-  a=5 #To decare a variable of integer type, We need not to declare its type it will be detected autoomatically while runtime.
             b="Tarique"  #Single quote or double quote can be used to declare a string
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans.To take input from user in python we can use a function called as input()
    syntax- a=input("Enter a number") #This will display a message "Enter a number" to user and he will be able to enter a number
                                      #Here we must notice that it will take input in string format 
Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans. String
Q8. What is type casting?
Ans.Type casting means changing the data type of any variable from one data type to another
    ex- a=5            # This will declare a variable a with int type and if we want to convert it in another data type we can do it as follows
        b=float(a)     # This will change the datatype from int to float
  
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans.Yes we can take more than one input from user using split
    ex- a,b,c=input("Enter three values").split()  # by default we need to provide a single space between these values
        print("Value of a",a,"Value of b",b,"Value of c",c)
        
        
        a,b,c=input("Enter three values").split(",")    # In this case we can seperate our values using a comma
        
Q10. What are keywords?
Ans. Keywords are collection of few reserved words in python that hold special meaning. We can not use keywords in a variable name as it will be confusing for interpreter. some keywords are if, else, for, while e.t.c 
Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans.No, we can not use keywords as a variable as these are reserved words that holds some special meaning for example - if we are using for as a variable name than our interpreter recoganise for as a looping statement so it will think that we have written for loop with a wrong syntax there is no way we can tell interpreter that we want to use it as a variable. so, to avoid this kind of confusion it's better to avoid using keywords as a variable.
Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans.Indententation means a blank space produced by leaving some space at the begining of a line. It is used in python as a syntax for example if we are writing for loop then after writing 'for expession: ' we leave some space in the next line with proper indentation such that next statement will belong to for statement. This increases readablitity of the code and also use of bracket is omitted.
Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans.we can throw some output in python using print() statement. Whatever enclosed inside this curly braces will be output on the terminal.
Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators
Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans. / is a airthmetic operator when used gives output in decimal form where as // operator gives us values in integer form i.e. all the values after decimal will be lost. ex-  a=5
           b=2
           a/b=2.5
           a//b=2
Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans. print("iNeuron"*4)
Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

a=int(input("Please enter a number to check weather it is even or odd"))
if a%2==0:
   print(a,"is a even number")
   
else:
   print(a,"is a odd number")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans.Any operator that gives output in the form of true or false can be termed as boolean opeartor. There are three logical operators that are used to compare values. They evaluate expressions down to Boolean values, returning either True or False .
Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 - 1
